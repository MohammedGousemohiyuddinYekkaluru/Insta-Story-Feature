# 📸 Insta Story Feature

A simple Instagram-like story viewer built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

### 🚀 Features
- Horizontal scrollable story bar  
- Dynamic story generation from JavaScript array  
- Full-screen story preview on click  
- Auto-hide story after 5 seconds  

### 💡 Tech Stack
- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- Vanilla JavaScript  

### ⚙️ How It Works
1. Stories (DPs and story images) are stored in an array.
2. Each story is dynamically rendered in the story bar.
3. On clicking a DP, the corresponding story image appears fullscreen and disappears automatically after 5 seconds.

### 🧠 Future Improvements
- Add progress bar animation  
- Add tap-to-skip or swipe navigation  
- Add transition/fade effects for smoother UX
